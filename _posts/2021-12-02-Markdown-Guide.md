## Why I Post This

I have learned **Markdown language** for writing my blog on Github Pages, yes, which one you are reading right now! That's why I should post one page for Markdown guide.

Anyway, we can start the main content from now.

### Emoji

There are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files:
1. copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text.
2. type emoji shortcodes.

#### Copyong and Pasting Emoji

In most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org) and paste it into your document.

> If you're using a static site generator, make sure you [encode HTML pages as UFT-8.](https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/)

I am very happy here because I can copy and paste emoji here. ðŸ˜ƒ   

#### Using Emoji Shortcodes

**Some Markdown applications** allow you to insert emoji.  
Sorry, Jekyll's Markdown processor doesn't support emoji shortcodes, so I can't show you any example here. ðŸ˜¥(This sad face is pasted here!)

```
That is so funny! :joy:
```

### Highlight

**Some Markdown processors** allow you to highlight text.  
Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the **mark** HTML tag.   

I need to hightlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.

```
I need to hightlight these ==very important words==.
I need to hightlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.
```

### Subscript

**Some Markdown processors** allow you to use subscript.  
Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the **sub** HTML tag.   

H<sub>2</sub>O

```
H~2~O
H<sub>2</sub>O
```

### Superscript

**Some Markdown processors** allow you to use superscript.  
Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the **sup** HTML tag.  

x<sup>2</sup>

```
x^2^
x<sup>2</sup>
```
