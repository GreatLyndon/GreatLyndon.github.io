# What is Markdown?

Ummmm, good question, but I won't talk about thing like this here.  
If you want to know them, just click the link on the top of this post, thanks. :)  

So, right now, let just start!

# Basic Syntax

---

## Heading

```
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

Heading level1
===

Heading level2
---
```
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

Heading level 2

1. It has total 6 different sizes of the first kind of headings, 1 to 6, and 2 of the second kind.
2. You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility.

---

## Paragraphs

```
p1

p2
```

p1

p2

1. To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
2. Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

## Line Breaks

```
Before line breaks  
After line breaks
```

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

---

## Bold

```
**bold text**

__bold text__

a**B**c
```

**bold text**  
__bold text__  
a**B**c  

 Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis.

---

## Italic

```
*italicized text*

_italicized text_

a*B*c
```

*italicized text*  
_italicized text_  
a*B*c  

For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.

---

## Bold and Italic

```
This text is ***really important***

This text is ___really important___

This text is __*really important*__

This text is _**really important**_

This text is **_really important_**

a***B***c
```

This text is ***really important***  
This text is **_really important_**  
This text is *__really important__*  
This text is ___really important___  
This text is __*really important*__  
This text is _**really important**_  
a***B***c  

For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis.
